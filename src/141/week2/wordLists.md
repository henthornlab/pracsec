# Wordlists

On the Try Hack Me challenge from last week, we needed to supply a wordlist to gobuster to make it work.

These are curated lists of common words used in websites, accounts, passwords, etc.

## RockYou

The most famous of these wordlists comes from a hack of an app on a social network.  

From Wikipedia:


> Data breach 
> In December 2009, the company experienced a data breach resulting in the exposure of over 32 million user accounts. 
> The company used an unencrypted database > to store user account data, including plaintext passwords (as opposed to
> password hashes) for its service, as well as passwords to connected accounts at > partner sites (including Facebook,
> Myspace, and webmail services). RockYou would also e-mail the password unencrypted to the user during account recovery.
> They also did not allow using special characters in the passwords. The hacker used a 10-year-old SQL vulnerability to
> gain access to the database. The company took days to notify users after the incident, and initially incorrectly reported
> that the breach only affected older applications when it actually affected all RockYou users.[4]

> The full list of passwords exposed as a result of the breach is available in Kali Linux, and has been since its launch 
> in 2013. Due to its easy attainability and comprehensive length, it is commonly used in dictionary attacks.[21]

So it's a list of MILLIONS of common passwords.
