# echo'ing hex values

Sometimes we need to send hex values to a remote system to test out an edge case. The ```echo``` command can help... just use the ```-e``` command line option.

Try piping echo into your connection. In this case, we're connected using netcat.

```
echo -e "\xde\xad\xbe\xef" | nc <host> <port>
```

Want to suppress the newline?  Use ```-n```

```
echo -e -n "\xde\xad\xbe\xef\x03\x34\x43\x0d\x0a" | nc <host> <port>
```
