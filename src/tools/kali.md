# Kali Linux

The most famous distribution of Linux used by hackers worldwide. The main website is [here](https://www.kali.org/).

Note that Kali is based on Debian Linux, so you can find tips on setup, package management, etc. by searching for Kali, Debian, or even Ubuntu.

From the Kali website:


```The Kali Linux distribution is based on Debian Testing. Therefore, most of the Kali packages are imported, as-is, from the Debian repositories. In some cases, newer packages may be imported from Debian Unstable or Debian Experimental, either to improve user experience, or to incorporate needed bug fixes.```

I prefer create a VM from scratch using an ISO from [here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images).

If you have a working hypervisor and are on PC, you can also grab a pre-built VM image from [here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)

As of August 2023, the most recent version is 2023.3
