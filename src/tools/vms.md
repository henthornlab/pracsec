# Virtual Machines

Many of us run our CTF/penetration testing tools inside a *virtual* machine instead of on our desktop. 

This helps because we can:
* keep our own machines free of extraneous tools
* protect our machines from software of unknown origin
* run tools that are not native to our default OS

Before you can run a virtual machine (the guest), you need to set up the host machine as a hypervisor.
